# 🎓 Predicting Graduate School Admissions

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a student's admission to graduate school based on academic and profile features like GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, and more.

## 📁 Project Overview

Graduate school admissions are competitive and influenced by various factors. This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow to model and predict admission chances using real-world data.

## 🔍 Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and checking data distributions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Used visualization techniques to understand feature relationships and trends in the data.

- **Feature Selection**  
  Implemented **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most influential features.

- **Model Building**  
  Trained and evaluated multiple models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Performance assessed using:
  - R² Score
  - AUC-ROC Curve
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy
